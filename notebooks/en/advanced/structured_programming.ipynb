    "        - `root`: path to the directory where datafiles can be found\n",
    "    - `variable`: has fields:\n",
    "        - `name`: the name of the variable we want to plot\n",
    "2. `iglob(path.join(model.root, \"luca*.gzip.h5\"))` similar to executing the bash\n",
    "command `ls /path/to/model/luca*.gzip.h5` terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "On a relatively unrelated note, I recommend checking out the `os.path` module of the Python standard library. It has many useful functions for manipulating filepaths and can replace most of the shell functionalities in a cross-platform way (i.e. it works on Windows, Linux, Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are willing to sacrifice backward compatibility, the `pathlib` (available since Python 3.4) module is, in my opinion, a better replacement of the `os.path` functions.\n",
